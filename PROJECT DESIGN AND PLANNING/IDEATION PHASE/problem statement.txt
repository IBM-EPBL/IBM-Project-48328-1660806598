PROJECT NAME: Fertilizer Recommendation System For Plant Disease Prediction
MAXIMUM MARK: 2 Marks

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Agriculture is the most important sector in today’s life. Most plants are
affected by a wide variety of bacterial and fungal diseases. Diseases on plants
placed a major constraint on the production and a major threat to food security.
Hence, early and accurate identification of plant diseases is essential to ensure
high quantity and best quality. In recent years, the number of diseases on plants
and the degree of harm caused has increased due to the variation in pathogen
varieties, changes in cultivation methods, and inadequate plant protection
techniques. An automated system is introduced to identify different diseases on
plants by checking the symptoms shown on the leaves of the plant. Deep learning
techniques are used to identify the diseases and suggest the precautions that can
be taken for those diseases.

I am         The farmer who is trying to cultivating the crops for
             huge profit and very control in using fertilizer on the
             crops.
 
I’m trying to Use the recent technologies to avoid disease in crops
              and trying increase the quantity and quality of crops.
              But I am unaware of the existing technology that can help
              me a lot to predict the disease and I don’t know to use
              the correct fertilizer for disease.

Because       I don’t want to spoil the soil quality and crops quality.

Which makes  I’m not capable of cultivating the crops and
Me feel      maintaining the quality of land and producing good
             quality of crops.
